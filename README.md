# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The model is deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Database** and contains health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and more.

## Features Used
- **Pregnancies**
- **Plasma Glucose Concentration**
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure**
- **Triceps Skin Fold Thickness**
- **Serum Insulin**
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
- **Age**

## Installation
